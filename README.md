## Baltic trawl survey data

This repo contains historical data from Sweden and Latvia, and code to standardize those and early BITS data from [DATRAS](https://www.ices.dk/data/data-portals/Pages/DATRAS.aspx) by gear dimensions, following [Orio et al., (2017)](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/74/5/1322/2972205). The scripts produce a cleaned file of biomass density per length class and haul for a few common species. The outputs from the historical scripts can easily be integrated with newer DATRAS data standardized in the same way.
